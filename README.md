# Obsidian Random Retrieval Plugin

**Note**: in the very early stage, NOT STABLE !!

This plugin was developped to open a random note based on local LLMs with Obsidian.
- Random for Random Note in Obsidian
- Retrieval for Retrieval Component in Haystack

I developped this plugin because .. I have a bad memory... and I enjoy the pleasure of treasure Hunt. While
- Search provides multiple way to reveal those sporadic ideas hidden in the vault,
- Random Note, as a core plugin, provides a complete random way to dig it out...

I choose LLM to be a retriver + ranker, so that this plugin can function like a fuzzy-search / half-random-note.


## Installation

- at the first time 

conda create --name rr-env

pip install -r requirements.txt

- and then (for the most users)

open plugin in obsidian (a terminal will be activated automatically) 

click ribbon button, and enjoy the nightwalkðŸ’¡

(please keep the terminal open while you run the plugin)

- and then (for the developpers)

feel free to replace rr_app.py with your models
